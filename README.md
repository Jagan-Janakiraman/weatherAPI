# weatherAPI
Weather API application using Python Flask framework
The weather API project I developed using Flask is a web application that provides users with real-time weather information for a given location. The application utilizes the Flask framework to handle incoming requests and retrieve weather data from a third-party weather API.

Using the application, users can input their desired location, such as a city or a specific geographical coordinate. The Flask server then sends a request to the weather API, fetching the relevant weather data based on the user's input.

Once the data is retrieved, the Flask application processes it and presents the information in a user-friendly format. This includes displaying the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other relevant weather details. The data can be shown on a web page or returned in JSON format for integration with other applications.

To enhance the user experience, error handling is implemented to gracefully handle situations where the API response is unavailable or invalid. The Flask application also supports caching mechanisms to reduce the number of API calls and improve response times for repeated requests.

Overall, this weather API project showcases your skills in Flask, API integration, data processing, and web development. It demonstrates your ability to create a practical application that delivers real-time weather information to users in a convenient and accessible manner.
